Yogesh Variant of Interpolation Search

Overview

This repository's first contribution is a variant of the Interpolation Search algorithm, designed to drastically reduce time complexity when searching for an element in a sorted array.

Algorithm Explanation

1. Calculate the difference between the smallest and largest elements.
2. Compute the quotient by dividing the difference by the array size.
3. Divide the array into quotient-sized parts.
4. Compare the middle element with the key:
    - If matched, return the middle index.
    - If arr[mid] > key, traverse backward from mid to i-quotient-1 and compare.
    - If arr[mid] < key, traverse backward from size-1 to i-quotient-1 and compare.
5. Repeat steps 4 until the element is found.

Time Complexity

Average time complexity: O(log log n)

Performance

Optimized for small and medium-sized arrays, reducing comparisons.
